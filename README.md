# AUESOME---Robustness-Test
CNN for Syntethic Images Classifier Through Spectral Analysis


DATASAT @ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tristanzhang32/ai-generated-images-vs-real-images?resource=download-directory


TIMELINE

- Build the dataset
- Choose the best CNN model to be implemented
- Extract DFT and Cosine Transform from every image of the dataset
- Start training the NN on the augmented dataset
- Test the model once trained
- Stress the model with data augemntation

Shall we think about three dymensional DFT? And try to compute the three channels differently?

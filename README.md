# AUESOME---Robustness-Test
CNN for Syntethic Images Classifier Through Spectral Analysis



TIMELINE

- Build the dataset
- Choose the best CNN model to be implemented
- Extract DFT and Cosine Transform from every image of the dataset
- Start training the NN on the augmented dataset
- Test the model once trained
- Stress the model with data augemntation
